Intro: Founded in 2017 by Aaron Aujla and Benjamin Bloomstein, Green River Project LLC’s research-based approach to building furniture and interiors has been shaped by ten years of studio practice as artists in New York City. Along with private commissions for residential interiors, each year Green River Project LLC produces four collections of furniture and sculptural objects centered around a unique narrative.
